# CPSC-362-Fitness-Tracker

We'll build a fitness tracker app that will require login credentials as well as log past workout and meal plans. We'll incorporate a basic nutrition table to count calories that'll require user input to save their meal entries. A prompt that'll require the user to input their physicals will be made and compared to a standard BMI chart to come up with calorie and workout goals. A list of basic workouts will be made available to log workout plans as well.
